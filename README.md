The goal of easyalgorithms is to provide the two algorithms euclidean & dijkstra.

## Installation

You can install the released version of easyalgorithms from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("easyalgorithms")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(easyalgorithms)
# Call function euclidean
euclidean(x, y)

# Call function dijkstra
dijkstra(graph, init_node)
```
